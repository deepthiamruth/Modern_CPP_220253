class Engine should have the following attributes
    - engine id of type string 
    - engine_type which could be HYBRID, ICE or ALTERNATE_FUEL
    - engine_cc which is float
    - engine_torque float 
    - engine_horsepower int
    
Create the following functionalities in functionalities.cpp file

    1) Create 5 objects of the class Engine on the heap . Attach a shared_ptr to each object created and emplace these shared_ptr into a list container
    
    2) A function to return a container of shared_ptr pointing to objects which satisfy the predicate condition passed

    Hint: Accept a predicate, apply it on data container , identify objects that meet predicate condition and return a container of pointers to such objects

    3) A function to find and return if at least one object meets a predicate condition passed

    4) A function to find the average m_engine_cc and return the value
